NCCID project summaries
=======================

NCCID users are required to provide a project summary describing the aim of their research and the purpose for utilising NCCID data.
Below is a list of the projects currently ongoing, as described by the researchers.


University College London
-------------------------

University College London plans to store the NCCID data in a highly secure XNAT repository to enable imaging-based research at UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC). In particular, researchers at CMIC will use these data to build artificial intelligence models to automatically detect COVID-19 patients based on their CT or X-ray images, such that, in the future, these images can be screened automatically before doctors read them. This will significantly save time in managing future outbreaks. The research also involves building computational models to analyse the outcomes for those with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, predicting best management for individual patients. These predictions may shorten their hospital stay, reduce complications and even save lives. Finally, the project will investigates methods to deploy these developed models to local hospitals quickly and safely.  

University of Cambridge
-------------------------
It is strongly believed that early detection of COVID-19 and intervention leads to lower Covid-19 mortality because it enables disease treatment via
oxygen therapy and control of spread via isolation. The diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens. However, testing the general population is proving to be
very challenging because of various reasons including limitations of sample collection and transportation, kit performance and availability,
limitations in capacity, etc.
 
Chest scans could include x-rays, CT and MRI scans. Chest CT scans are used to examine lung tissues and often used for further investigation after
an abnormal chest x-ray. Chest MRI scans provide a detailed picture of the chest wall, heart, and blood vessels. These scans are carried out routinely
for a variety of medical reasons, including preparation for surgery, annual follow-ups, accident and emergency, etc. The creation of computer systems that can automatically process these scans to detect and identify signs of Covid-19 can provide added value for the NHS with no significant additional burden on staff, resources, operational costs, etc. The development of these systems require the implementation of cutting-edge image processing and artificial intelligence technologies.
 
X-ray images and CT scans can also be useful in monitoring the progression of Covid-19 patients as they can reveal if their lungs are filled with sticky mucus that can lead to breathing problems and provide a benchmark for comparisons with previous scans.
 
This project aims to find the visual signatures of Covid-19, as they appear in chest scans, that can lead to accurate diagnostic and prognosis for use in
hospital settings. Automated imaging algorithms, aided by advanced artificial intelligence techniques, can detect some of the abnormal features
appearing in these scans, such as ground glass patterned areas, Ground glass, Crazy paving, Vascular dilatation, Traction Bronchiectasis. These features are generally not specific to Covid-19 and could be seen with other infections. Hence, it is important to develop AI techniques to aid the imaging analysis to increase the accuracy of diagnostic.

University of Bradford
-------------------------
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, and severe cases can lead to pneumonia and ultimately death. The diagnosis can be confirmed by laboratory testing; however, the test has low sensitivity which leads to late diagnosis and treatment. Chest X-rays and CT scans provide valuable diagnostic and monitoring information that can complement the laboratory and clinical data. In this project, we propose to develop an open-source artificial intelligence tool that combines chest imaging data and clinical data to support the diagnosis, triaging and prognosis for COVID-19 in the UK. This will make clinical decisions more efficient, accurate, timely, and potentially cheaper, leading to better patient outcomes.
