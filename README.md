# COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database

[NHSX](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/) and the [British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI)](https://www.bsti.org.uk/)
have formed a joint partnership in order to create a national database of chest CT, MRI, and X-ray images.
This is to enable the validation and development of automated analysis technologies, and to promote research
projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This repository contains tooling related to the NHSX National COVID-19 Chest Image Database (NCCID).
